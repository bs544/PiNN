# The PiNet network

The PiNet network implements the network architecture described in our
paper.[@2020_ShaoHellstroemEtAl] The network architecture features the a
graph-convolution which recursively generates atomic properties from its
environment.

One distinctive feature of PiNet is that the convolution operation is realized
with pairwise functions whose form are determined by the pair, called pairwise
interactions.
